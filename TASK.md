# Introduction

Hello and welcome to the Wayflyer take home assignment! We very much appreciate you taking the time to complete it and
hope you enjoy yourself!

The assignment is to write a lightweight billing system to charge our customers daily. In the next stage of the interview
process, you'll collaborate with an engineer on our team to discuss and extend your solution.

To keep this exercise fair for all future candidates, *please keep your solution private*.

## The Exercise
Our core financial product is the Merchant Cash Advance (MCA), which is a form of revenue based financing. Our customers
will sell us their future sales in return for cash now. We'll transfer them the cash directly to their bank account, then
commence billing the next day. Every day we'll charge them a pre-agreed percentage of their previous days sales until
they've paid us back the amount, plus a small fee we charge for the service.

Write a program that interacts with the API described below that correctly bills all our advances over the simulated
period.


## API Reference

Your billing implementation should interact with this simple Restful API we've created for this exercise. The API
returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP verbs and response codes. No authentication is required.

You should simulate the passage of time by including an HTTP header `Today: {date}` with each request. The API will return
data as though the request was made on that day. The simulated period starts `2022-01-01` and ends on `2022-07-01`.

HTTP POST request headers should include `Content-Type: application/json`.

For this exercise you should assume there is only one global currency. All monetary amounts are encoded as strings with two
decimal places encoding the lowest denomination (i.e. "12345.67").

All dates should be encoded as `{yyyy}-{mm}-{dd}`, i.e. `2022-03-21`.

The base URL for all requests is: `https://billing.eng-test.wayflyer.com/v2`. This is a live server with sample data you should use to develop your code.


### Advances
Fetch all advances issued to customers.
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```
GET /advances

Response:
{"advances": [
  {
    "id": 1001,
    "customer_id": 1,
    "created": "2022-01-02",
    "total_advanced": "60000.00",
    "fee": "2000.00",
    "mandate_id": 102,
    "repayment_start_date": "2022-01-07",
    "repayment_percentage": 11
  },
  ...
  ]
}
```

</td>
<td>

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| id    | The unique identifier for each advance. |
| customer_id | The unique identifier for the customer this advance is for. |
| created | The date the advance was agreed. This may be before repayment starts. |
| total_advanced | The monetary amount advanced to the customer. |
| fee | The fee for this advance, to be paid back in addition to `total_advanced`. |
| mandate_id | The unique identifier of the direct debit mandate to charge this advance with. |
| repayment_start_date | Repayments should start on this date, and continue every day until the advance and fee have been repaid. |
| repayment_percentage | The percentage of daily revenue that should be repaid. |

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> Important: New advances are created regularly as we sign up new customers and give additional advances to existing customers.

### Revenues
Retrieve the revenue for a given customer for a given date.
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```
GET /customers/:id/revenues/:for_date
        
Response:        
{"amount": "1234.56"}
        
Errors:
530 Revenue not yet available
```

</td>
<td>

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| id | The unique identifier for the customer. |
| for_date | The date the revenue was received by the customer. |
| amount | The amount of revenue received. |

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> Important: Due to problems with third-party systems, a customer's revenue for a given day may not be available until
> a later day. In this case, we should bill the customer as soon as the revenue becomes available, unless the advance has
> otherwise been fully repaid.

### Charges
Issue repayment charges against a given mandate
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```
POST /mandates/:id/charge
BODY {"amount": "1234.56"}

Errors:
530 Charging not possible at this time
```

</td>
<td>

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| id | The unique identifier for the mandate. |
| amount | The amount to charge against the given advance. |

</td>
</tr>
</table>

> Important: The total charges made against any advance should not exceed `10000.00` on any given day. Charges greater
> than this should be split over multiple days.

> Important: Due to problems with the direct debit mandate, charges on a given day may be rejected. In this case,
> charges should be issued on subsequent days.

### Billing Complete
Indicate that billing has been completed for a given advance. This should be called following successful final payment.
<table>
<tr>
<td>

```
POST /advances/:id/billing_complete
BODY {}
```

</td>
<td>

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| id | The unique identifier for the advance. |

</td>
</tr>
</table>

## Evaluation
When evaluating your work, we ask the following questions:
1. How do you follow and implement a set of requirements?
1. How do you make it easy for us to understand and run your solution?
1. How do you ensure your code is robust and working as expected?
1. Is the code you produce well written, easy to follow and maintainable?

If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out to us!

## Submitting your results
Send us an archive containing your project including any documentation required to set up and run your solution.

# Guidelines
This is a language agnostic challenge - we recommend that you use the language you are most comfortable with!

It is important that your code is clear, idiomatic and maintainable. Tests are expected.

To constrain the exercise, do not worry about data persistence; state maybe held in memory, and you may assume that the
execution environment is 100% reliable.

Focus on meeting the specification first. Polish if you have the time. Good solutions can be implemented in under 3 hours.

If you do run short of time, make sure you annotate your code with TODOs highlighting where your code does not meet the specification, requires improvement and/or is missing tests.

You are welcome to structure the code as you like, but the entry point to your code might look something like:
```python
def run_billing(today: date):
    ...

def simulate():
    for today in date_range(START_DATE, END_DATE):
        # pass `today` in your API request headers
        run_billing(today)
```

You can test the API from the command line:

```
curl -H "Today: 2022-01-02" https://billing.eng-test.wayflyer.com/v2/advances
curl -H "Today: 2022-01-02" https://billing.eng-test.wayflyer.com/v2/mandates/1/charge -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"amount": "1.00"}'
```

Please let us know as soon as possible if there is a problem with the API.
